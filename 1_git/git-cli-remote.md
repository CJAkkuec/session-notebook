# Git CLI & Remote

## Git CLI

Git CLI is a command line tool for version control that empowers developers to manage their projects efficiently. It enables seamless interaction with remote repositories, facilitating collaboration and streamlined project management.

## Git Remote

Remote repositories serve as centralized hubs for collaboration in version control systems like Git. They allow developers to store and share their project's code, making it easier for team members to work together, track changes, and ensure code integrity.
